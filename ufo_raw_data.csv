I run into the house and shut off the flood light as I thought it may be messing with my vision go back outside and it is pitch black and the sky is clear, I look around in the direction I saw the thing at first kinda scan the sky and observe 3 of the same kind of lights moving in kinda the same direction they were not in a line they were not stagered evenly. They also weren't all moving in a straight line I pull out my phone and record video after observing for about a min and they move out of sight dog is still out doing his thing somewhere behind the house. At that time I ran into the house stopped the recording and yell for my stepson to tell him and show him what I saw when I play the video all the begining part is gone didn't record and its only a few seconds of pitch black and me talking to myself and then going in the house and it stops. So I'm sitting here typing this shortly after this happened and I'm quite baffled to what I just saw I also checked flight radar to see if anything was in my area and there really wasn't anything that would have stuck out like a sore thumb.

They moved in concert and varied their formation from line abreast to random form and spacing. They would randomly and individually dim their lights down to the vanishing point then individually increase them to a very high intensity. They all remained above the horizon up to ten degrees elevation and the range was totally indeterminate. We were traveling at 450 kts groundspeed and never apparently closed the range. They could have remained at a range of 100 miles and been operating at sixty thousand feet, or they could have been fifty mikes high at a range of 2,000 miles and been located West of Portland, OR over the Eastern Pacific ocean. If they were space borne then reflective illumination by the sun cannot explain the varying intensity of their lights. We were west bound at high altitude and flying in clear air with an undercast which topped out about 39,000 ft. The ARTCC was Cleveland Center. We queried a controller about the sighting and he merely acknowledged it, but handed our inquiry to the next controller who subsequently asked us about our observation when we checked in on VHF.

"2025-12-02 21:00 Local Reported: 2025-12-03 12:53 Pacific Duration: 3ish minutes No of observers: 1 Location: Seattle, WA, USA Location details: In my living room looking out the north facing windows towards downtown Seattle Shape: Orb Color: White or blue Estimated Size: Larger than a helicopter Viewed From: Land Direction from Viewer: Facing north Angle of Elevation: 45 Closest Distance: Maybe a mile or two Estimated Speed: Slow to extremely fast Explanation: Searchlight - Possible Characteristics: Lights on object, Aura or haze around object Something zipped past the clouds outside my windows which drew my attention. Three more were moving around then took off I was sitting in my living room in Beacon Hill, just outside downtown Seattle, facing west and watching television. The blinds on the north-facing window were completely open. Suddenly, something very bright and fast zipped through the overcast clouds from west to east, right at the point where the roofline of my house meets the sky. This caught my attention and caused me to turn and look. Further north, I noticed three lights in the sky. At first, I dismissed them as spotlights, but I kept glancing back because their movement was unusual. The lights would separate, then come back together. Occasionally, one would zip away and then return. They moved in circles, traveled side by side, peeled off in different directions, and at times moved in a distinct zig-zag pattern. What prompted me to get up and move closer to the window was the realization that each of the lights had a bright white ball at its center—something not typical of spotlights. Additionally, when the lights moved through the clouds and separated, they did not diffuse or angle outward the way a normal spotlight beam would. I turned off the lights in the room to get a better look. When I returned with my camera, the lights were gone. I waited to see if they would reappear, but they did not.

Three more were moving around then took off I was sitting in my living room in Beacon Hill, just outside downtown Seattle, facing west and watching television. The blinds on the north-facing window were completely open. Suddenly, something very bright and fast zipped through the overcast clouds from west to east, right at the point where the roofline of my house meets the sky. This caught my attention and caused me to turn and look. Further north, I noticed three lights in the sky. At first, I dismissed them as spotlights, but I kept glancing back because their movement was unusual. The lights would separate, then come back together. Occasionally, one would zip away and then return. They moved in circles, traveled side by side, peeled off in different directions, and at times moved in a distinct zig-zag pattern. What prompted me to get up and move closer to the window was the realization that each of the lights had a bright white ball at its center—something not typical of spotlights. Additionally, when the lights moved through the clouds and separated, they did not diffuse or angle outward the way a normal spotlight beam would. I turned off the lights in the room to get a better look. When I returned with my camera, the lights were gone. I waited to see if they would reappear, but they did not.

By smoking and joking on the back side of your hootch. We started talking about life, aliens and ill that kind of stuff. We talked for a long time about things and after awhile of talking the first odd thing that happened was we heard hustling in some bushes about 15 to 20 yards to our 1 to 2 o'clock. We continued to talk when after the awhile the sighting happened, which in the middle of my buddy talking he stopped and said look. To which to our 11 o'clock a blue orb about 25 to 30 yards away and ranging 5 ft off then ground , colored as blue was floating left to right as viewing it from us looking at it from front facing it. It continued to dance around before going up left at angle then moving up right then going straight up at which point it disappeared. ( when the orb moved there was a small trail of light coming off of it. ) After that we were all kind of shocked smoked one more cig then headed to rack out. The hootch had bunk beds on either side, I slept in a bottom bunk at them very end of the hootch, I would wake up once in the middle of the night, I remember laying on my back and as woke up i remember fire watch was just passing near my area and heading to walk back up towards the other side of the hootch. I then looked over too my left and saw a creature I have never seen since or ever. It looked humanoid with a head that was similar to ours but more stubby and wider and shaped like ours in a oval way but different. Its eyes were similar to ours in shape but bigger and black or seemed that way as its was too dark to see color if it had any. It was small in body stature with small hands with fingers that were long. It was hanging off the ladder that was leading to the top bunk. It had what seemed to be hair but patchy or very little and seemed to be wearing a raggy top shirt or covering. It blinked at me then I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I didn't feel threatened but was still shock and just rolled over . Lastly we got back on our vessel after our training was done, arriving back on ship at night when heading to the smoke pit there was about 20 or 30 people in awe as off in the distance over whatever city we could see. A orange orb was moving oddly as it was traveling from one point to another very fast and zig zagging. Not like in the way a helicopter or plane would travel. Then a helicopter flew very low over top of us and heading towards where the orb was over the city. At which they orb moved in one more drastic manner then disappeared.

Then we were both seeing it at the same time,…I went to say “what the f is that”….and as soon as I got to the f word, it swooped down from the clouds, literally like a dip or a swoop if that makes sense….it was way wider than the road we were driving on, but the lights were so bright that you could not make out a shape…and within 2-3 seconds after that, it took off at an unexplainable speed and left a slight blue trail.

Description of the Event At approximately 04:00 AM, while inside my house, I observed two extremely bright, colored flashes of light outside my window. The flashes appeared in a fixed position in mid-air, at an estimated height of 2–3 meters above ground level, and at a distance of about 8 meters from my position. Each flash lasted about one second, and the two flashes occurred 2–3 seconds apart.  The colors were different: one appeared green, the other red, or close variations of these colors. The intensity of the light was very strong — comparable to a “colored lightning flash” — yet the event was completely silent, with no sound before, during, or after the flashes. ⸻ 2. Post-Event Observations Immediately after the flashes, I went outside and observed smoke/haze exactly at the same position in the air where the flashes had occurred. Characteristics of the smoke: •   Color: between white and light gray •   Appeared suspended in mid-air at the same height as the flashes •   Slowly rose upward before dissipating •   No smell of any kind •   No debris or physical objects were found on the ground underneath ⸻ 3. Environmental Context •   The incident took place in a dead-end residential street with single-family houses. •   I have clear visibility of the entire street; there were no people or activity outside at that moment. •   There are no electrical boxes, transformers, or power lines at the location of the flashes. •   There was no power outage, electrical disturbance, or noise. •   Weather conditions were calm, and no storms or atmospheric disturbances were present. ⸻ 4. Witness Assessment Based on the characteristics of the event, the phenomenon does not resemble: •   fireworks or flares, •   electrical arcing or power faults, •   drones or aircraft lights, •   falling objects or meteor activity. The flashes did not originate from above or below; they appeared instantly in a fixed point in the air. ⸻ 5. Classification UAP Category: UAP-L (Luminous) – Low-Altitude Static Event Key Features: •   Colored flashes at 2–3 m altitude •   Completely silent •   Two flashes, different colors •   Mid-air smoke with no source •   No physical evidence •   No apparent human or technological origin ⸻ 6. Additional Notes This event fits the profile of rare low-altitude luminous UAP sightings reported internationally, characterized by sudden, stationary light manifestations with color variation and post-event haze, lacking mechanical behavior or identifiable source.

Then, one by one, they began to disappear—as if a light were being switched off When I first noticed them, there were five in total. Four appeared slightly smaller and positioned very close to one another, aligned, while a fifth object was a bit farther away and appeared somewhat larger. They began disappearing one at a time, with the larger object remaining visible the longest. They simply disappeared—they did not appear to fly away or move in any direction.

Viewed From: Land Direction from Viewer: West Angle of Elevation: 45 Closest Distance: Unsure. Estimated Speed: I can’t calculate that, but FAST. Characteristics: Aura or haze around object, Missing Time 3 lights, started as 1, then formed a triangle formation as 3, 2 shot off, then 1 came back. I’m a truck driver. I’m driving down highway 50 from Dodge City Kansas to Hutchinson Kansas. I see a really bright light in the sky, and assume it’s a plane or something. Then I see 2 more appear and form a triangle formation and begin zigzagging around each other and circling in this triangle formation. 2 shoot off faster than I’ve ever seen anything move. 1 came back and joined the 1st one. They kept zipping off and coming back, brighter, then dimmer. The second one circled around the first one and they both took off. I watched them for about 20 miles up until the Loves in South Hutchinson. The sky was clear, they seemed to take off once when a plane was passing through then reappeared out of nowhere.

Cruising at FL330 heading east, with the sun already set behind us. Sky was pitch black. I'm used to observing Starlink and other satellites and meteorites. This one was what looked like a satellite of medium brightness. I saw it as it was moving from north to south, about 5 to 10 degrees above my viewpoint and moving at minimum 20 to 30 degrees per second to the right (southbound). Ive seen satellites and meteorites, the latter moving generally the fastest, but this was at least 3 or 4 times as fast. Funny thing is it looked like an ordinary satellite. Distance and size is impossible to estimate.

As I was looking for a place to sleep for the night I layed down because I was tired, as I’m laying there I’m looking at the sky and seeing the regular planes, stars, but out of nowhere a white light I’m assuming the size of a plane because how else would I be able to see it from the ground. The light was almost dancing or playing right above me ,way up in the sky but above . Im religious so i automatically thought about the star that led the wiseman to Jesus but if you know the story that star was the devil so i got really freaked out because it stayed there for an hour dancing or whatever .It scared me to the point where i had to call one of my church leaders who told me that it may be a satélite but no I know what I saw and it wasn’t no satélite.It would change shapes from a circle to something longer almost like a human shape.I just had to let someone know because planes were flying right next to it.It even looked like they were gonna collide but they didn’t.

Looking up at the sky. Moving around. As high as a star. Shape: Circle Color: Mostly white-ish Estimated Size: Wasn’t sure if it was a star at first. Not sure Viewed From: Land Direction from Viewer: I’m not directionally inclined. But I asks my grandma who’s from the area, she says maybe South Angle of Elevation: 90 Closest Distance: It appeared as though it was among the stars. Estimated Speed: It could go from stop 0- different speeds Characteristics: Lights on object, Aura or haze around object Something as high as the stars started moving back the other directions us when I knew something’s different.. I work graveyard shift at work. I was out in the parking lot taking out trash/looking for possible contraband on property. As I’m about to go back to the building to go inside, I’m looking up at the sky at the stars and I see a light moving just as high. I was trying to figure out what it was. It was as high as the stars. It wasn’t blinking at first but I couldn’t tell for sure at first. It was moving to the left in the sky slowly. Then as I’m trying to figure out what this thing was, like a satellite or something. It then goes the opposite direction/to the left and starts moving in these wierd ways. I thought I better take a video, I cause some of it, but not great footage because I am working/dont want to look crazy/dont want to get abducted if it’s real. Then when I started taking the video, at first I thought maybe something was flashing, but it was actually pulsating.. I went back inside the building. And as I was walking back to the office, I just wanted to double check just to see. Stepped out the side door, looked up, it was slowly moving to the right at this point. If there’s that satellite looking thing to the right as well, it was maybe going that direction. Then the light stopped, and I decided to go back inside to work.
